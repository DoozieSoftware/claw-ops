# ClawOps Outreach Templates
**Status:** DRAFT v1.0.0
**Purpose:** Founder-led sales to CTOs/Tech Leads

---

## Template A: The "War Story" Hook (LinkedIn Post)

**Context:** You see a company that recently launched an AI product/demo.

**Copy:**

> "Just saw [Company Name]'s new AI [feature/product]. Looks solid.
> 
> One 'invisible' problem I've seen bite teams post-launch: **Ops Debt on the agent infra.**
> 
> The setup that worked for a 2-person demo rarely survives production traffic, privacy audits, or the first breaking upgrade.
> 
> If you're scaling your OpenClaw/LangGraph setup beyond 'demo mode,' you're probably already feeling the drag.
> 
> We built ClawOps to fix exactly that. It's not a product (it's ops). It's not cheap (it's $199/mo). It's boring, reliable, and someone else's problem.
> 
> If your team is drowning in infra config, let's talk. Quick audit, fixed scope, predictable cost."

## Template B: The Direct DM (High-Velocity)

**Context:** Cold outreach to a Tech Lead.

**Copy:**

> "Hi [Name],
> 
> Quick Q: Are you running [OpenClaw/AutoGen/LangGraph] in production yet?
> 
> If yes, how's the upgrade hygiene? Most teams I've talked to say it's a nightmare of config drift and 'it worked yesterday' moments.
> 
> We (ClawOps) handle the hardening, the backups, and the monthly upgrades for a flat $199/mo. You keep the agents, we keep them running.
> 
> Happy to do a quick 'risk audit' of your setup if you're curious.
> 
> No hard sell either way."

---

## Template C: The "Referral" Ask (Post-Sale)

**Context:** Asking for referrals after a successful setup.

**Copy:**

> "Thanks for the trust on the ClawOps setup. Glad we got your agents hardened and backed up.
> 
> One favor: Do you know any other teams struggling with agent infra? CTOs or Eng Leads who are spending more time on config than logic?
> 
> If you can make an intro, I'd be happy to give them a free 'Risk Assessment' report—no strings attached. It usually saves them a weekend of debugging."

## Template D: The "No-Brainer" Close (Retainer Conversion)

**Context:** Closing a QuickStart client onto a Care retainer.

**Copy:**

> "The QuickStart is done. Your agents are running, hardened, and we have a rollback plan.
> 
> Here comes the 'Week 2 Problem': You'll need to upgrade eventually, and one bad update breaks everything.
> 
> We offer 'ClawOps Care' ($199/mo) to handle upgrades, monitoring, and minor tuning. It turns this:
> [Screenshot of error logs]
> Into this:
> [Screenshot of clear logs]
> 
> Most clients find 2 hours of their own time is worth more than $200/mo. If that's you, great. If you want to sleep through the next upgrade, let me know."
