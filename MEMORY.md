## SOUL.md Framework (Key Innovation)

Each client gets a **custom SOUL.md** that defines:

1. **Bot Identity** — Name, channels, purpose
2. **Boundaries (DENY ALL)** — Explicit allowlist only
3. **Validation Engine** — Automated checks before every action
4. **Safety Guards** — Alerts on violations, block threats
5. **Audit Trail** — Every action logged

### SOUL Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Identity | Bot name, channels, purpose |
| Boundaries | Allowed/blocked actions |
| Time Limits | Active hours, read-only hours |
| Geo Limits | Allowed countries |
| User Allowlist | Who can use the bot |
| Validation Rules | Pre-action checks (5 things) |
| Safety Guards | Alert triggers |
| Audit Format | Log structure |

### Security Layers
```
Layer 1: 🔒 IMMUTABLE (Master Token only)
         Core OpenClaw, skills, scripts
Layer 2: 🔐 LOCKED (Client or Master Token)
         Configs, client files
Layer 3: 🔓 ALWAYS MUTABLE (Agent BRAIN!)
         Memory, data, context ← PROTECT THIS!
Layer 4: 📝 APPEND-ONLY
         Logs
```

### Token System
- **Master Token**: Generated by ClawOps vault, signed with private key
- **Client Token**: Generated by ClawOps, signed with private key
- **Verification**: Offline using ClawOps public key embedded in client skill

### Offline Update Flow
```
ClawOps (creates signed package)
        │
        ▼
Signed with PRIVATE KEY
        │
        ▼

        │
        ▼
Client verifies (OFFLINE!) with PUBLIC KEY
        │
        ▼

```

## Backup Strategy (3-2-1 Rule)

```
3 copies of data
2 different media
1 offsite (USB in safe)
```

| Backup Type | Where | When | Retention |
|------------|-------|------|-----------|
| Git | GitHub | Auto (changes) | Forever |
| Local | ~/.clawops-backup/ | Daily (2 AM) | 30 days |
