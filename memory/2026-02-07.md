## Lessons Learned

1. **Execution > Planning**: Product is ready. Stop building, start selling.

2. **Ethical Marketing**: Building trust is better than aggressive tactics.

3. **Slow & Steady**: 5-10 messages/day is sustainable. 100/day leads to burnout.

4. **Focus**: Target AI/tech companies - they understand automation value.
