## ClawOps Business

### What We Built
- **Service**: Managed OpenClaw setup + operations for enterprises
- **Repos**:
  - Public: `DoozieSoftware/claw-ops` (landing page + channels + AI recommendations)
  - Private: `DoozieSoftware/claw-ops-internal` (configs, templates, engineer guide, use-case-engine skill)

### Key Decisions
1. **No Fork Strategy**: Use upstream OpenClaw core, add value via skills/plugins, not core changes
2. **Channels**: Focus on WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord (high-value only)
3. **AI Providers**:
   - Enterprise: Claude.ai, GPT-4o, Gemini
   - Mid-Range: GLM, Kimi, Minimax (internally tested, Minimax recommended)
   - Note: API costs billed by provider, NOT included in our fees

### Pricing
- QuickStart: $99 (1 channel, 1 use case)
- Starter: $199 (1 channel, 3 use cases)
- Business: $499 (all defaults, all channels)
- ClawCare: $99/mo (support and maintenance)
- Indian Clients: 30% off, GST extra

### Pipeline Use Cases
